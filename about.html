<h2>About</h2>

<p>OpenACalendar is an Open Source collaborative group wiki calendar, with strong 
	Open Data tools baked in.</p>

<p>We can let any user add and edit events, like a wiki, or only certain users 
	can have edit rights. All edits and deletes are versioned to ensure safety,
	like a wiki.</p>

<p>There are feeds and an API so exporting the data into the system of your choice 
	should be easy. It handles multiple countries and/or time zones on the same calendar.</p>

<p>One installed base of this system can run one calendar, or run several calendars.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p><a href="http://opentechcalendar.co.uk/">Open Tech Calendar</a> was started 
	in July 2012 after a similar calendar listing tech events
	run by <a href="http://techmeetup.co.uk/">Tech Meetup</a> was accidentally 
	destroyed. We set out to create a calendar that was more useful, could welcome 
	more contributors and crucially, was less likely to be accidentally destroyed.</p>


<p>The first version, a Mediawiki site with a plugin, was launched in 4 days.</p>

<p>Several months later the second version, a custom written webapp, was launched.</p>

<p>Over winter 2013/2014, a new version was written that lets several calendars be 
	run from the same install. From this new codebase, 
	<a href="http://opentechcalendar.co.uk/">Open Tech Calendar</a> was switched over,
	<a href="http://ican.hasacalendar.co.uk/">HasACalendar</a> was put online and 
	<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">OpenACalendar</a> was released.</p>


<p>The original developer <a href="http://jamesbaster.co.uk">James Baster</a> is 
	available thru <a href="http://jmbtechnology.co.uk/">JMB Technology Limited</a> 
	- ask about support contracts or one-off consultancies.</p>
