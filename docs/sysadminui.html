<h2>Accessing in Single Site Mode</h2>

<p>Note some calendar functions are accessed by going to "/admin". Here you can 
	set other users up to be a calendar admin. This is different from being a 
	real systems administrator. </p>

<p>Go to "/sysadmin".</p>

<p>Note in this mode you still have to select which site (ie Calendar) you want to work with, 
	even thought there is only one.</p>

<h2>Accessing in Multi Site Mode</h2>

<p>Go to the site domain configured for the "webSysAdmin" folder.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>As well as the users normal password, an additional password is required to access 
	the Sysadmin UI. It is set in config.php.</p>
