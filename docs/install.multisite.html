<h2>Install Multi Site Mode</h2>

<p>Get the code and place on a web server.</p>
<p>Set up a Postgres database.</p>
<p>Copy config.dist.php to config.php and edit.</p>
<p>Run the PHP script "extension.Core/cli/upgradeDatabase.php".</p>

<p>The folder "webIndex" must be served by the webserver, on a single name (eg "www.example.com"). Enable SSL if possible.</p>
<p>The folder "webSysadmin" must be served by the webserver, on a single name (eg "sysadmin.example.com"). Ideally, only serve this over SSL.</p>

	subdomain to reach it (eg "*.example.com"). Enable SSL if possible.</p>
<p>Note you may have to be careful about the order of the apache virtual hosts to 
	make sure that the  "webSite" folder does not get requests intended for the "webIndex" or 
	"webSysAdmin" folders.</p>
