<h2>Build folder</h2>

<p>The build folder contains scripts to build assets (JS, CSS, images) for developers.</p>

<p>JS, CSS and images should be stored in a folder in an <a href="extensions.html">extension</a>. 
	If a later extension has 
	an asset with the same name as an earlier one, it overrides the earlier one. In this way, 
	a extension can theme and style a site without having to edit the "Core" extension.</p>
