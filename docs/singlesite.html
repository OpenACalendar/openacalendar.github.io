title: Single Site Introduction

<h2>Single Site Mode</h2>

<p>Single Site means that the installed code base only runs one calendar. 
	See <a href="http://opentechcalendar.co.uk">Open Tech Calendar</a> for an example.
	This is the simpler mode to install.</p>

<p>In Single Site Mode, one calendar is set up then simply used as the calendar for all requests.
	Thus it is possible to turn a site from Single Site Mode into Multi Site Mode.</p>

<h2>Multi Site Mode</h2>

<p>Multi Site means that the installed code base can run more than one calendar. 
	See <a href="http://ican.hasacalendar.co.uk">HasACalendar</a> for an example.
	This is the more complex mode to install.</p>

<p>You need to be set up several web roots with several different virtual hosts. 
	One of them will need a domain name that allows subdomains configured (eg *.example.com).</p>
