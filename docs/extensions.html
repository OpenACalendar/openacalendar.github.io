<h2>Extensions</h2>

<p>Extensions hold templates, setup information, code and assets (JS, CSS, Images). 
	An extension can be added to add additional functionality. 
	The "Core" extension provides the basic system functionality.</p>

<h2>Adding an extension</h2>

<p>Add the folder into the root of the app, along side the "extension.Core" folder. 
	Edit config.php and add the extension.</p>

<p>Extensions can provide assets (JS, CSS, Images) and you may need to run the 
	<a href="build.html">build scripts</a> to copy the right assets into the web folders.</p>
