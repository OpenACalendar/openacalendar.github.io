<h2>Extensions</h2>

<p>Extensions hold templates, setup information, code and assets (JS, CSS, Images). 
	An extension can be added to add additional functionality and theme assets. </p>

<h2>Installing an extension in v1.1.0 upwards</h2>

<p>Check the extension documentation for additional instructions, but the basic process is simply to add the folder into the "extension" folder in the root of the app. 
	Then edit config.php and add the extension.</p>

<p>Extensions can provide assets (JS, CSS, Images) and you may need to run the 
	<a href="build.html">build scripts</a> to copy the right assets into the web folders after installation.</p>
