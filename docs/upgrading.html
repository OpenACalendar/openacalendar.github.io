<h2>Upgrading</h2>

<p>Place the new files over the old ones. (If you have had to change any 
	"localConfig.php" files to accomodate your webserver, be careful to preserve 
	the changes.</p>

<p>Run the PHP script "core/cli/upgradeDatabase.php".</p>

<p>Run the PHP script "core/cli/loadStaticData.php".</p>

<p>On servers not in Debug mode, delete the existing cached templates. These are 
	found in "cache/templates.cli" and "cache/templates.web". (It doesn't hurt to 
	do this on debug servers so if in doubt, just do it.)</p>
