We are [at RESTfest](https://github.com/RESTFest/2016-Edinburgh/wiki)! Today at the hackday we worked on:

  *  A Vagrant box for PHP7
  *  Our first front end test! It's really simple, but it works and there is a Vagrant box for running these tests.
  *  Some UI stuff around filters.

We also had some great conversations and got some great feedback - thanks to everyone involved!
