Version 1.5.5 is released! Details of the changes [are here](http://ican.openacalendar.org/webapp/release/1.5.5.html).

To upgrade, [follow these instructions](http://docs-superusers.openacalendar.org/en/v1.5.x/upgrading.html.

This contains a new feature - optionally using CDN's for front end library loading for speed. There is a new config variable, "useLibraryCDNs". This is off by default now for backwards compatibility, but will be on by default from v1.6.x.

It also contains many bug fixes.

Security issues or really bad bugs aside, this will hopefully be the last release in the v1.5.x branch. v1.6.0 is coming soon!
