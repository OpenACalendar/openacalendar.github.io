Version 2.0.0 is released! Details of the changes [are here](http://ican.openacalendar.org/webapp/release/2.0.0.html). To upgrade, [follow these instructions](http://docs-superusers.openacalendar.org/en/v2.0.x/upgrading.html).

Note the minimum requirements have been raised to PHP 7.0! As part of this, a lot of libraries have been updated to newer versions and we have started to use some of the PHP 7.0 features.

There aren't much feature changes, but a release to put this on a stable footing was long overdue. With this stability, we can now look to grow with new changes.
