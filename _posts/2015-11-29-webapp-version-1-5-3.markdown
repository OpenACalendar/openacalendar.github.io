Version 1.5.3 is released! Details of the changes [are here](http://ican.openacalendar.org/webapp/release/1.5.3.html).

To upgrade, [follow these instructions](http://docs-superusers.openacalendar.org/en/v1.5.x/upgrading.html).

This contains a crucial bug fix - you could not add a curator to a curated list, and people could still use the contact form when the site was in read only mode.

Thanks to [em-12](https://github.com/OpenACalendar/OpenACalendar-Web-Core/pull/478) for contributing to this!
