Version 1.5.0 is released! Details of the changes [are here](http://ican.openacalendar.org/release/1.5.0.html).

To upgrade, [follow these instructions](http://docs-superusers.openacalendar.org/en/v1.5.x/upgrading.html).


Note we have made our own task system. The cron jobs you have running will have
to be overhauled, but the good news is this should be the last time you will have to do that.
