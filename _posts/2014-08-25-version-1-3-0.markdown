Version 1.3.0 is released! The big change that justifies a new major release is a completely new UI for editing the Venue or Area for an event. The old one was very confusing and due an overhaul.

Details of the changes [are here](http://ican.openacalendar.org/release/1.3.0.html).

To upgrade, [follow these instructions](http://docs.openacalendar.org/en/v1.3.x/serveradministrators/core/upgrading.html).
