Version 1.7.2 is released! Details of the changes [are here](http://ican.openacalendar.org/webapp/release/1.7.2.html). To upgrade, [follow these instructions](http://docs-superusers.openacalendar.org/en/v1.7.x/upgrading.html).

Minor Security Issue; anyone could stop users following groups, areas or sites. But they can't use this to gain more access to an account.
