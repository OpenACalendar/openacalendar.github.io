Version 1.3.1 is released, with some small improvments and an important bug fix. Details of the changes [are here](http://ican.openacalendar.org/release/1.3.1.html).

To upgrade, [follow these instructions](http://docs.openacalendar.org/en/v1.3.x/serveradministrators/core/upgrading.html).

We are taking things a bit slow here but that doesn't mean stopped - we are already working on some big overhauls for the next big version, [version 1.4.0](http://ican.openacalendar.org/release/1.4.0.html). While we do that we'll let the v1.3.x branch settle down into a really stable release.
