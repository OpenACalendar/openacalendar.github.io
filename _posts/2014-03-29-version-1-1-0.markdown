We are pleased to announce a whole bunch of new features! We are very pleased with this release, as many of the new features are improvements to the user interface and the common tasks people do on the site. We think the basic structure of the site is working fine and are now in the process of smoothing out the rough edges.

Details of the changes [are here](http://ican.openacalendar.org/release/1.1.0.html) or [on this Open Tech Calendar blog post](http://blog.opentechcalendar.co.uk/2014/03/23/new-features-released/).

To upgrade, [follow these instructions](http://ican.openacalendar.org/docs/upgrading.html) noting there is [a new cron task to install](http://ican.openacalendar.org/docs/cron.html) and [a new extension you may want to install](http://ican.openacalendar.org/docs/extension.AddressCodeGBOpenCodePoint.html).
