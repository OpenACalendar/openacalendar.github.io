We're currently working on [MeetYourNextMP](http://meetyournextmp.com/), a crowd sourced list of hustings for the general election in the UK.

Lots of new features have been done for this which will be released after the election. Watch the animated GIF below to see 3 of them (1 min long):

  *  A New Event Wizard - to try and make the creation process less disjointed and guide people through it better, while also more carefully encouraging them to add crucial data.
  *  Custom Fields - add any and as many free text fields to an event as you want!
  *  Comments - add a comment every time you make a change.

[MeetYourNextMP](http://meetyournextmp.com/) is being done with [Democracy Club](https://democracyclub.org.uk/) - thanks for all the support, suggestions and help!

Thanks also to [Edinburgh UX meetup](https://opentechcalendar.co.uk/group/204-edinburgh-ux-meetup) for the UI chat!
